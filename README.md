# FashionMNIST 

## Description

The goal of this project is to classify the images in the FashionMNIST dataset using the Support Vector Machine model. 

The dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. 

For the implementation, we wanted to use the SVM model with the linear, polynomial, sigmoid and RBF kernel in order to compare the results in the matter of accuracy, time, errors and confusion matrix. 

For optimization, we used the Grid Search method with the most commonly used parameters.
